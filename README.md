### Hi there!👋 My name is Cienna Van 

Nice to see you here! I am currently a second year Software Engineering Student at Carleton University. In the 10th grade, I took my first coding course and was quickly intrigued in a new way of thinking. I am learning and looking to grow into this field more everyday! Outside of schoolwork, you can find me hanging out with friends, dancing, or editing videos! 

- 🗺️ I am based in Ottawa, Ontario
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and JavaScrip
- 🤔 I’m looking to learn more about UI/UX design
- 📧 You can contact me at ciennalvan@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to experiment with different matcha recipes ☕
